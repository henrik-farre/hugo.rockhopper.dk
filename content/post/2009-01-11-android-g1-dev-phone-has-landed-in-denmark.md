Finally, my HTC G1 Dev Phone running Android OS has arrived!
<!--more-->

It could not be shipped directly to Denmark so it had to make a detour via Germany.

The phone arrived in a small plain white box without any branding whatsoever. The box contained:

  * The HTC G1, no branding, but with the specially designed developer battery cover
  * Battery charger. Danish users: an adaptor is needed, see photos
  * Head phones that connect directly to the micro usb port
  * Micro usb to usb cable
  * A quick set up guide

A 1 Gb MicroSD card was already installed in the phone.

After activating 3G service at Telmore (danish mobile phone provider) I was able to sign in and start using the phone.
