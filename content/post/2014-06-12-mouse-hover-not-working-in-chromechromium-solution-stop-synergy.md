I had a strange problem: when I was using Chromium (Open source version of Chrome): mouse hover was not working. Click, scroll and so on worked fine, but when the mouse hovered above an element on a webpage nothing happend.

After googling I found that [synergy](http://synergy-project.org/) is the [cause](https://www.google.dk/search?q=chrome+hover+synergy), so now I only start synergy when I need it.
