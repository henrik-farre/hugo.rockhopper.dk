I had a strange problem: when I was using Chromium (Open source version of Chrome): mouse hover was not working. Click, scroll and so on worked fine, but when the mouse hovered above an element on a webpage nothing happend.

After googling I found that [synergy][1] is the [cause][2], so now I only start synergy when I need it.
